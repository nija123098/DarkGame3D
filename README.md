# DarkGame3D
A shelfed OpenGL game to learn low level 3D rendering and advanced physics simulation using inertial tensors made over a year ago.

The game architecture is my own, my rendering is based off of TheThinMatrix's early rendering code.

I stopped amid combining my rendering, newer tutorial rendering, and the game engine.  I stopped due to a lack of time and to start working on Inquisitor, then DiscordBot.

***The code under um.nija123098.darkgame is mine.***

***The code under Animation, Engine, and srcr is TheThinMatrix's and is also open source.***

I was attempting to combine some aspects of his code and mine.
This code was made, and left unfinished, over a year ago.  Please excuse the lack of good object oriented code style, which I was attempting to fix with the rewrite inspired by ThinMatrix's improved code.

I certainly want to return more to OpenGL rendering, perhaps when I have time again.

##### Note:
Liquids are another name for events.  The pipe is the distributor.
The game was built with the ability to both run the client and server together for ease of development.
Natives nor resources (except shaders which should probably be in the packages instead) are included in the repo.
I have a working source of just the rendering code somewhere.
For some reason I can't find the inertial tensor stuff.  I also have it somewhere.
